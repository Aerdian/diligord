# diligord

Diligord is a color scheme built for use in terminal emulators and many other cases.

### Installation
Installing and using this color scheme is super easy. After downloading and extracting the .zip archive, select
your terminal emulator or the format you would like to use. Each folder has a basic text document and you can
copy and paste the text into your config file to use the color scheme.

## Supported Emulators

* Chrome SSH
* Gnome Terminal
* Guake
* iTerm2

NOTE! X-Client applications are also supported through Xresources and Xshell files, including, 
but not limited to **rxvt** and **xterm**.

Please let me know if you have any issues with this or if you would like this supported in any other application.
